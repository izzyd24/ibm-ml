## Intent: 
Creating a sample space by section to track all progress in the IBM-ML certification course. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
### Week 2
#### Retrieving Data: 
New plan is to leverage sqlite3 connection via Py Juypter to view as tables instead. 

#### Cleaning Data: 
##### Plan: 
New plan is to access from .db file and then begin cleaning process as tables or dfs. 
When doing so we need to look at column, beyond removing the following: 
X, Y, Z

Once we remove this columns entirely, we must decide if we want to "remove", "impute", or "mask" data rows. 
###### Remove Approach: 
For columns w, an q we want to remove the rows entirely because z. 
Pros:
Cons:

###### Impute Approach: 
For columns w, an q we want to impute or replace with substituted values. In doing so, we will either use the common value OR average from entire column with randomized value because z. 
Pros:
Cons:

###### Mask Approach: 
For columns w, and r we want to create a new category for missing values ("masking") because Z. 
Pros:
Cons:
